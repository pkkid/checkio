# https://py.checkio.org/mission/visibilities/

# This mission is an adaptation of the "Range" game (fromSimon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection).    If you are lost or just want to play, the game is availablehere.
# 
# You're on a rectangular grid. Each numbered box corresponds to the number of empty    cells in all four directions from it (but not diagonally), including itself.    In order to satisfy these requirements, you have to arrange black boxes     in empty cells to limit visibility.
# 
# Two additional rules:Two black boxes can't be neighbors horizontally or vertically.Black boxes can't separate white cells into several parts.
# 
# Empty boxes are represented by zeros.
# 
# Then, you have to return the coordinates of black boxes.
# 
# Input:A list of lists of integers.
# 
# Output:An iterable of tuples/lists of two integers.
# 
# Preconditions:Given puzzles are solvable.5 ≤ len(grid) ≤ 50 and 5 ≤ len(grid[0]) ≤ 50.all(len(row) == len(grid[0]) for row in grid).
#
