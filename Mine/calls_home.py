He took the bills for Sophia's calls from the last few days and wants to calculate how much it costs.
# 
# The bill is represented as an array with information about the calls.    Help Nicola to calculate the cost for each of Sophia calls.    Each call is represented as a string with date, time and duration of the call in seconds in the follow format:
# 
# "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss duration"The date and time in this information are the start of the call.
# 
# Space-Time Communications Co. has several rules on how to calculate the cost of calls:First 100 (one hundred) minutes in one day are priced at 1 coin per minute;After 100 minutes in one day, each minute costs 2 coins per minute;All calls are rounded up to the nearest minute. For example 59 sec ≈ 1 min, 61 sec ≈ 2 min;Calls count on the day when they began. For example if a call was started 2014-01-01 23:59:59, then it            counted to 2014-01-01;
# 
# For example:
# 2014-01-01 01:12:13 181
# 2014-01-02 20:11:10 600
# 2014-01-03 01:12:13 6009
# 2014-01-03 12:13:55 200
# First day -- 181s≈4m -- 4 coins;
# Second day -- 600s=10m -- 10 coins;
# Third day -- 6009s≈101m + 200s≈4m -- 100 + 5 * 2 = 110 coins;
# Total -- 124 coins.
# 
# Input:Information about calls as a tuple of strings.
# 
# Output:The total cost as an integer.
# 
# Precondition:0 < len(calls) ≤ 30
# 0 < call_duration ≤ 7200
# The bill is sorted by datetime.
# 
# 
# END_DESC
