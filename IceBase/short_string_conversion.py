# You are given two strings, line1 and line2. Answer, what is the smallest number of operations you need to transform line1 to line2?
# 
# Operations are:
# 
# Delete one letter from one of stringsInsert one letter into one of stringsReplace one of letters from one of strings with another letter
# 
# Input:two arguments, two strings.
# 
# Output:int, minimum number of operations.
# 
# 
# Precondition:0<= len(line)<100
