# There are four substring missions that were born all in one day and you
# shouldnâ€™t be needed more than one day to solve them. All of those mission can
# be simply solved by brute force, but is it always the best way to go? (you might
# not have access to all of those missions yet, but they are going to be
# available with more opened islands on the map). It is the fourth and the last
# mission of the series. But if in the first mission you needed to find repeating
# letters, then in this one you should find a repeating sequence inside the
# substring. I have an example for you: in a string 'abababc' - 'ab' is a sequence
# that repeats more than once, so the answer will be 'ababab'
# 
# Input:String.Output:String.
