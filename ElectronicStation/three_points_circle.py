# Nicola discovered a calliper inside a set of drafting tools he received as a gift.    Seeing the caliper, he has decided to learn how to use it.
# 
# Through any three points that do not exist on the same line, there lies a unique circle.    The points of this circle are represented in a string with the coordinates like so:
# 
# 
#     "(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)"
# 
# Wherex1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3are digits.
# 
# You should find the circle for three given points, such    that the circle lies through these point and return the result as a string    with the equation of the circle.    In a Cartesian coordinate system (with an X and Y axis),    the circle with central coordinates of (x0,y0) and radius of r can be described with the following equation:
# 
# 
#     "(x-x0)^2+(y-y0)^2=r^2"
# 
# wherex0,y0,rare decimal numbers rounded totwo decimal points.    Remove extraneous zeros and all decimal points, they are not necessary.    For rounding, use the standard mathematical rules.
# 
# 
# 
# Input:Coordinates as a string..
# 
# Output:The equation of the circle as a string.
# 
# Precondition:All three given points do not lie on one line.
# 0 < xi, yi, r < 10
