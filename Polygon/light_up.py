# https://py.checkio.org/mission/light-up/

# This mission is an adaptation of the "Light Up" game (fromSimon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection).	If you are lost or just want to play, the game is availablehere.
# 
# You're on a rectangular grid and have to light all the cells.	For that, you have to put some lights in dark cells (so no light should illuminate another).	The lights that you have illuminate in the four directions from wall to wall.	And there are constraints: some walls must have a given number of lights close to them.
# 
# The grid will be represented by a tuple of strings. Cells that are in the dark	will be represented by ' ', walls by 'X' and numbers '0', '1', '2', '3' and '4'.
# 
# You have to return coordinates of all lights you want to illuminate the entire grid.
# 
# Input:A tuple of strings.
# 
# Output:An iterable of tuples/lists of two integers.
# 
# Preconditions:Given puzzles are solvable        and there is only one solution (when coordinates are sorted).7 ≤ len(grid) ≤ 50 and 7 ≤ len(grid[0]) ≤ 60.all(len(row) == len(grid[0]) for row in grid).
